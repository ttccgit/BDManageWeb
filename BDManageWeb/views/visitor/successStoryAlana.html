        Member Alana Monteiro has run after a healthy weight, lost 22 kg and became twice
        vice-champion of street runs.</p>

    <p class="section_title">
        First impressions</p>

    <p>
        After having joined Vigilantes do Peso, Alana left behind all the crazy diets and
        the yo-yo effect. “I urgently needed to find a way to lose weight in healthy and
        sustainable way to get my self-esteem back,” she says.</p>

    <p>
        At her first meetings, however, she wasn’t very confident. “In the beginning, I
        wasn’t sure about the program’s efficacy, because I didn’t believe that just by
        changing eating habits I would get good results,” says Alana. And she was right.
        To achieve a healthy weight, it is indeed necessary to change more than that. By
        attending the Vigilantes do Peso’s meetings, she learnt that the program is comprehensive:
        it is also about moving more, getting support from the group and developing healthy
        habits.</p>

        In a short period of time, we can say that Alana realized that she could turn physical
        activity into an ally to lose weight. “I’ve always enjoyed running, but being overweight
        was an obstacle. I was always too tired and unmotivated,” she says. Before joining
        Vigilantes do Peso, she used to run for 35 minutes together with her husband and
        her brother-in-law twice a week.</p>

    <p>
        In the beginning, she ran to lose weight. Then, she found out that losing weight
        to run was also a good idea. The more weight she lost, the more energy she had,
        the fitter she was.</p>

    <p>
        Excited by the results of her trainings, she looked for competitions and joined
        one of them. “Reaching the podium was a great achievement, especially because my
        intention was just to join the competition,” she says proudly. Last July, she was
        vice-champion once more, in the same competition.</p>

    <p>
        “With the help from Vigilantes do Peso I have lost weight healthily and got results
        I had never thought I would be able to,” she says. “I’m active because I like it,
        not because I need to, even being aware of all the benefits of physical activities
        to our body and mind (…) Running helped me to get fit. Now climbing up stairs is
        no sacrifice. I don’t feel that tired anymore.”</p>

    <p>
        Alana says that she tracks her <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> Ativos − the ones generated by physical
        activities – but has never needed to use them, as her Daily Target made her feel
        satisfied. “I’m very proud of having managed to have my healthy weight back. Better
        than that, I’m happy I did it with no sacrifices, eating what I like!”, she concludes.</p>

                <p> What is tracking, and why should I do it?</p>

                <p> Tracking means keeping tabs on the ProPontos value of everything you eat and all the activity you
                    do.You'll also track your weight once a week.</p>

                <p> Tracking makes you aware of what you're eating and how many ProPontos values you're using.Over time
                    it'll teach you how to make smarter food choices, and it'll also show you where trouble spots
                    lurk.Best of all, studies show that keeping track of food intake can help with weight loss success.

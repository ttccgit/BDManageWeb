                <p>Every food and drink has a <span class="pro_font">ProPontos ®</span> value, based on its nutritional
                    makeup — protein, fiber, fat and carbs.
                    What you eat and drink each day should add up to your daily <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span>
                    Target, which is determined by your age, height, weight and gender.</p>

                <p> You can eat whatever you like, and a great place to start is by figuring out the <span
                        class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> values of the foods you regularly eat in yourPointsPlus
                    Tracker.
                    You can settle for the result as is, or try these tricks for getting a great bang for your buck:</p>

                <p> 1. Play with portion sizes — you can adjust these in the <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span>
                    Tracker.<br>
                    2. Find a lower <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> value version of what you want to eat.<br>
                    3. Pick an alternative, low-<span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> value food.<br>

                </p>
                 <p>
                     It’s also a good idea to focus on Power Foods, which we’ve determined will help you stay satisfied
                     longer and deliver more nutrients for the <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> value.
                     They’re identified by green triangles in our database.

                     It's important to fit all food groups into your Target each day. That will give you better
                     nutrition and much-needed variety.
                     You can distribute it however you like, but here are a few suggestions for various Targets.

                 <p>
                     You’ll notice that fresh fruits and vegetables, have 0 <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span>
                     values. They’re such healthy, filling choices that we want to encourage you to eat them.
                     Consider them prepaid! Some condiments and small portions of other foods have 0 <span
                         class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> values, too.
                 </p>
                  <p>
                      All fresh fruit and most vegetables have been assigned <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span>
                      values of 0.
                      We’re assuming you’re going to eat a reasonable amount of these, and that’s already factored into
                      your daily <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> Target.

                <p> Physical activity can help you lose weight, is important for keeping it off, and can also help
                    improve your health. Our Activity Assessment tool can give you a weekly activity <span
                            class="pro_font">ProPontos®</span> goal that will help you see these benefits.
                    Your aim is to work up to earning 4-6 activity <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> values per
                    day.</p>

                <p> You don’t have to work out at the gym to get the physical activity you need. Any kind of movement is
                    good for you – from walking around the block to everyday activities like gardening.
                    Walking is one of the simplest and best exercises to build on.</p>

                <p>Read our safety tips before starting. Whatever activity you do, we want you to start slowly and build
                    up gradually. You should always talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program.
                    Do not exercise without professional supervision if you’re more than 30 pounds overweight.
                </p>
                 <p>
                     To find the <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> value of an activity, search for them by name
                     in the Activity Tracker, or use the activity <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> Calculator.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     The activity <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> values you earn are based on your current
                     weight, the time you spend moving, and the intensity of your efforts.
                     Be realistic about your intensity level so you don't overestimate the number of <span
                         class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> values you earn.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     The <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> Tracker will by default swap the activity <span
                         class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> values you’ve earned for food <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span>
                     values if you’ve used up your weekly <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> Allowance. (If you
                     prefer to use your activity <span class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> values before your weekly <span
                         class="pro_font">ProPontos</span> Allowance, you can change this by going to your Settings.)
